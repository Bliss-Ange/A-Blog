Message from Angelyn:
Dear invigilator,

I am using NextJs for the frontend development. 
Spent a little bit more time on the routing haha! Was so used to only go to pages and create whatever new page I was assigned.
After the frontend is run, please go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login2 for login page.
You may click on the logo and the header name to go to the post page. Or directly with http://localhost:3000/posts

In order to make the pages to look clean, was using MUI component for the frontend development.
Grid and Box are the two core tags that i used to make the posts with a better ui view
Pagination to let the post page load only limited post list (if exceed 10, user could click to the next page to view more)
icons to replace wordy button (for example: delete icon)

please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding on my assessment.
all my contact details are inside CV (I better not simply share my personal info in public git project ahhahaha><

Best,
Angelyn

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
